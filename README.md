Description
 I want to share my journey in building a simple booking  app. Hopefully this repository will be useful for others. I am always open for feedback, and other contributors would be super cool.

This app uses MVVM architecture and repository to handle the Firebase data source.

Technologies
Xcode
SwiftUI
Firebase
Swift Package Manager

How To Use
Note: This project uses Swift Package Manager to manage dependencies. Since the Firebase SDK is rather large, so it will take a little while.

You will need to set up a Firebase project.

1 Create account

2 Add a Project

3 Download the GoogleService-Info.plist file

Before you add the GoogleService-Info.plist file to your project, you should probably make sure itâ€™s in a gitignore  file. One simple way to do that is go to Xcode Preferences then Source Control then select git and add GoogleService-Info.plist file to ignored files.

4 Setup Authentication note this app uses Anonymous sign

5 Setup Cloud Firestore I just selected test mode for now. You will need to change later to suit your needs.
6 Storage
